\title{Test for a climate windows in data.}
\usage{
climatewin(Xvars, CDate, BDate, baseline, furthest, closest, FIXED, cutoff.day,
  cutoff.month, STATS = "mean", FUNCS = "L", CMISSING = FALSE,
  CINTERVAL = "D", nrandom = 0, CVK = 0, uppers = NA, lowers = NA,
  thresh = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{Xvars}{A list containing all climate variables of interest. Please specify the parent
  environment and variable name (e.g. Climate$Temp).}

\item{CDate}{The climate date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the
  parent environment and variable name (e.g. Climate$Date).}

\item{BDate}{The biological date variable (dd/mm/yyyy). Please specify the
  parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Date).}

\item{baseline}{The baseline model structure used for model testing.
  Currently known to support lm, glm, lmer and glmer objects.}

\item{furthest}{The furthest number of time intervals (set by CINTERVAL)
  back from the cutoff date or biological record that will be included in
  the climate window search.}

\item{closest}{The closest number of time intervals (set by CINTERVAL) back
  from the cutoff date or biological record that will be included in the
  climate window search.}

\item{FIXED}{TRUE or FALSE, whether you wish the climate window to be
  variable (i.e. the number of days before each biological record is
  measured) or fixed (i.e. number of days before a set point in time).}

\item{cutoff.day,cutoff.month}{If FIXED is TRUE, the day and month of the
  year from which the fixed window analysis will start.}

\item{STATS}{The aggregate statistics used to analyse the climate data. Can
  currently use basic R statistics (e.g. mean, min), as well as slope.
  Additional aggregate statistics can be created using the format
  function(x) (...). See FUN in \code{\link{apply}} for more detail.}

\item{FUNCS}{The functions used to fit the climate variable. Can be linear
  ("L"), quadratic ("Q"), cubic ("C"), inverse ("I") or log ("LOG").}

\item{CMISSING}{TRUE or FALSE, determines what should be done if there are
  missing climate data. If FALSE, the function will not run if missing
  climate data is encountered. If TRUE, any records affected by missing
  climate data will be removed from climate window analysis.}

\item{CINTERVAL}{The resolution at which climate window analysis will be
  conducted. May be days ("D"), weeks ("W"), or months ("M"). Note the units
  of parameters 'furthest' and 'closest' will differ depending on the choice
  of CINTERVAL.}

\item{nrandom}{Used in conjunction with \code{\link{randwin}}. Not to be
  changed manually.}

\item{CVK}{The number of folds used for the k-fold cross validation. By default
  this value is set to 0, so no cross validation occurs. Value should be a
  minimum of 2 for cross validation to occur.}

\item{uppers}{Cut-off values used to determine growing degree days or positive
  climate thresholds (determined by parameter thresh). Note that when values
  of lowers and uppers are both provided, climatewin will instead calculate a
  optimal climate zone (?).}

\item{lowers}{Cut-off values used to determine chill days or negative
  climate thresholds (determined by parameter thresh). Note that when values
  of lowers and uppers are both provided, climatewin will instead calculate a
  optimal climate zone (?).}

\item{thresh}{TRUE or FALSE. Determines whether to use values of uppers and
  lowers to calculate binary climate data (thresh = TRUE), or to use for
  growing degree days (thresh = FALSE).}
}
\value{
Will return a list containing three objects:

   \itemize{ \item BestModel, a model object. The strongest climate window
   model based on AICc. \item BestModelData, a dataframe with the data used
   to fit the strongest climate window model. \item WindowOutput, a dataframe
   with information on all fitted climate windows. Ordered using AICc model
   strength, with lowest AICc value first. See \code{\link{MassOutput}} as an
   example. }
}
\description{
Finds the time period when a biological variable is most strongly affected
 by climate. Note that climate data and biological data should be loaded as
 two seperate objects. Both objects should contain a date column to designate
 when the data were recorded (dd/mm/yyyy) and a response variable column.
