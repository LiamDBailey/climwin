}
\arguments{
\item{n}{The number of iterations used to run weightwin. If n > 1, iterations 
will use randomly generated starting parameters. These are stored in the 
output data frame `iterations`.}

\item{xvar}{A list object containing all climate variables of interest. 
Please specify the parent environment and variable name (e.g. Climate$Temp).}

\item{cdate}{The climate date variable. Please specify the parent environment 
and variable name (e.g. Climate$Date).}

\item{bdate}{The biological date variable. Please specify the parent 
environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Date).}

\item{baseline}{The baseline model structure used for testing correlation. 
Currently known to support lm, lme, glm and glmer objects.}

\item{range}{Two values signifying respectively the furthest and closest number 
of time intervals (set by cinterval) back from the cutoff date or biological record to include 
in the climate window search.}

\item{k}{The number of folds used for k-fold cross validation. By default
this value is set to 0, so no cross validation occurs. Value should be a
minimum of 2 for cross validation to occur.}

\item{func}{The function used to fit the climate variable in the model. Can be
linear ("lin"), quadratic ("quad"), cubic ("cub"), inverse ("inv") or log ("log").}

\item{type}{"absolute" or "relative", whether you wish the climate window to be relative
(e.g. the number of days before each biological record is measured) or absolute
(e.g. number of days before a set point in time).}

\item{refday}{If type is absolute, the day and month respectively of the 
year from which the absolute window analysis will start.}

\item{nrandom}{Used when conducting data randomisation, should not be
changed manually.}

\item{centre}{A list item containing:
1. The variable used for mean centring (e.g. Year, Site, Individual). 
Please specify the parent environment and variable name (e.g. Biol$Year).
2. Whether the model should include both within-group means and variance ("both"),
only within-group means ("mean"), or only within-group variance ("var").}

\item{weightfunc}{The distribution to be used for optimisation. Can be 
either a Weibull ("W") or Generalised Extreme Value distribution ("G").}

\item{cinterval}{The resolution at which the climate window analysis will be 
conducted. May be days ("day"), weeks ("week"), or months ("month"). Note the units 
of parameter 'range' will differ depending on the choice 
of cinterval.}

\item{cmissing}{Determines what should be done if there are 
missing climate data. Three approaches are possible: 
 - FALSE; the function will not run if missing climate data is encountered.
 An object 'missing' will be returned containing the dates of missing climate.
 - "method1"; missing climate data will be replaced with the mean climate
 of the preceding and following 2 records.
 - "method2"; missing climate data will be replaced with the mean climate
 of all records on the same date.
 
 Note: Other methods are possible. Users should consider those methods most
 appropriate for their data and apply them manually before using climwin if
 required.}

\item{cohort}{A variable used to group biological records that occur in the same biological
season but cover multiple years (e.g. southern hemisphere breeding season). Only required
when type is "absolute". The cohort variable should be in the same dataset as the variable bdate.}

\item{spatial}{A list item containing:
1. A factor that defines which spatial group (i.e. population) each biological
record is taken from. The length of this factor should correspond to the length 
of the biological dataset.
2. A factor that defines which spatial group (i.e. population) climate data
corresponds to. This length of this factor should correspond to the length of
the climate dataset.}

\item{par}{Shape, scale and location parameters of the Weibull or GEV weight 
function used as start weight function. For Weibull : Shape and scale 
parameters must be greater than 0, while location parameter must be less 
than or equal to 0. For GEV : Scale parameter must be greater than 0.}

\item{control}{Parameters used to determine step size for the optimisation 
function. Please see \code{\link{optim}} for more detail.}

\item{method}{The method used for the optimisation function. Please see 
\code{\link{optim}} for more detail.}

\item{cutoff.day, cutoff.month}{Redundant parameters. Now replaced by refday.}

\item{furthest, closest}{Redundant parameters. Now replaced by range.}

\item{grad}{Run the optimisation procedure with a numerically derived gradient function.
This can improve model convergence but will increase computational time.}
}
\value{
Produces a constantly updating grid of plots as the optimisation 
 function is running. 
 \itemize{ 
 \item Right panel from top to bottom: The
 three parameters (shape, scale and location) determining the weight 
 function.
 
 \item Left top panel: The resulting weight function.
 
 \item Left middle panel: The delta AICc compared to the baseline model.
 
 \item Left bottom panel: Plotted relationship between the weighted mean of climate 
 and the biological response variable.}
 
 Also returns a list containing three objects: \itemize{ 
 \item BestModel, a model object. The best weighted window model determined
 by deltaAICc.
 
 \item BestModelData, a dataframe. Biological and climate data used to fit
 the best weighted window model.
 
 \item WeightedOutput. Parameter values for the best weighted window.
 
 \item iterations. If n > 1, the starting parameters and deltaAICc values
 from each iteration of weightwin.

\description{
Finds the best weighted average of a weather variable over a period that 
correlates most strongly with a biological variable. Uses weibull or 
Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. See references for a full 
description.
